# Axis AoC

These are my solutions to the Axis advent of code challenge. I'm writing my solutions in c++ mainly because I'm taking it as a opportunity to learn and practice the language better.

## Run it yourself

-   At minimum C++17
-   (I'm using gcc to compile the program)

Each solution will contain a readme describing how to run the program. Where required, the directory also contains an inputfile.

# How to run

<i>This program needs to be compiled in order to run</i>

In your terminal, you can enter either

```bash
dec1.exe <inputfile.extension>
```

which will just run the 'distance program'

or

```bash
dec1.exe <inputfile.extension> <inputfile.extension>
```

which will just run both the 'distance program' and 'list simularity program'
